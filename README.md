**Team Members:**  
Jessica Sendejo


Create a game that allows the player to pop bubbles.  

**Must have features:**  
Main Menu that allows user to select from two different difficulties kids mode and normal mode  
Button to allow replay  
Button to allow to go back to main menu  
Pause Button that takes user to replay screen where user can replay level or go back to main menu  
Kids mode allows user to just pop bubbles for 60 seconds (maybe change name to easy mode)  
Normal allows user to pop bubbles for 60 seconds but there are also bombs. If touched, the bombs explode and screen clears. Can touch up to 3 bombs before game ends.  
Game scene will show timer that counts down from 60 and number of bubbles popped. Normal mode will also keep track of bombs touched.  

**Nice to have features:**  
Background music for scenes  
Implement a way to go back to same game if paused  
More than 2 levels
